**Hell-scape** is a 2D platformer created for the **EPITA S2 Project**. The game centers on the cooperation between two unlikely protagonists: **Angie**, an angel, and **Dimy**, a demon. Trapped in an infernal world inspired by Catholic and Greek mythologies, they must combine their unique powers to overcome obstacles and escape.

## 🎮 Gameplay Features

### Cooperative Mechanics
The game is designed for **two simultaneous players**. Success depends on synergy—certain paths can only be cleared by using both characters' skills in tandem.



### Unique Characters
* **Angie (The Angel):** Focuses on mobility and support. She possesses the ability to **fly** and **heal** her companion.
* **Dimy (The Demon):** Focuses on offense and agility. He is faster on the ground and can throw **projectiles** to defeat enemies.

### Retro Aesthetic
The game features a **pixel-art** style, paying homage to classic retro platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit eras.

## 🏛️ Lore & Inspiration
